# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! This project is for the needs of the Front-End Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.


## How to run the application

To run the application, use: `git clone https://github.com/Erufailo/Feed-Reader-Testing.git` and open the index.html on a browser. All dependencies are included.
